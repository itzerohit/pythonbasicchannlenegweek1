Week 1: Course Plan

comments
Welcome to Week 1 of your Data Science journey! This week sets the programming foundation you'll rely on throughout your course. You'll start by setting up Python and understanding how it works, then build your skills with variables, data types, control flow, functions and data structures. By the end of the week, you’ll be comfortable writing clean, efficient Python code with practical features like file handling, OOP and decorators.

Day 1 – Installation, Input/Output and Variables
Start from scratch by installing Python and writing your first few lines of code.

Install Python and set up your environment
Understand basic input and output operations
Learn about variables and naming conventions
Get introduced to Python keywords
Day 2 – Data Types, Operators and Conditionals
Dive into how Python stores data and processes logic.

Understand built-in data types like int, float, string, bool
Use arithmetic, comparison and logical operators
Write conditional programs using if, elif and else
Day 3 – Loops, Functions and Lambda
Automate repetition and reuse code with loops and functions.

Use for and while loops to iterate through data
Learn how to define and call functions
Explore lambda functions and understand when to use them
Day 4 – Strings and Lists
Start working with sequences two of Python’s most used data types.

Manipulate strings and use built-in string methods
Learn list creation, indexing, slicing and common list operations
Day 5 – Tuples, Sets and Dictionaries
Expand your toolkit with more advanced Python data structures.

Understand immutability with tuples
Explore unique-value storage using sets
Create and manipulate key-value pairs with dictionaries
Day 6 – Collections, Comprehensions and OOP
Make your Python code more efficient and organized.

Learn specialized container types from the collections module
Write one-liner logic with list, set and dictionary comprehensions
Get introduced to Object-Oriented Programming in Python
Day 7 – Exception Handling, File I/O and Advanced Python
Wrap up the week with advanced, real-world coding skills.

Handle runtime errors with try, except, finally
Work with files: read, write and manipulate text files
Explore useful features: generators, decorators, context managers and a basic intro to APIs
